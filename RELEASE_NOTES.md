# Release Notes

## v1.2 - OpenTopoData Migration & ViewShed Layer

This release replaces the Mapbox elevation API with OpenTopoData, adds a beta ViewShed visualization tool, and includes comprehensive code cleanup and security improvements.

### 🌐 Elevation Data Overhaul

- **OpenTopoData Integration**: Switched from Mapbox to OpenTopoData API for elevation tile fetching.
  - **98.8% API Reduction**: Batch requests reduce API calls from 256 to 3 per tile.
  - **No Authentication Required**: Works out-of-the-box with public API (1000 requests/day).
  - **Configurable Sources**: Support for custom/self-hosted OpenTopoData instances via environment variables.
  - **Rate Limit Handling**: Built-in 300ms delays between batches to respect free tier limits.
- **Environment Variables**:
  ```bash
  ELEVATION_API_URL=https://api.opentopodata.org  # Custom instance URL
  ELEVATION_DATASET=srtm30m  # srtm30m, srtm90m, aster30m, ned10m
  ```

### 🔭 ViewShed Layer (Beta) ⚠️ _In Development_

- **WebGL-Powered Visualization**: Real-time terrain visibility overlay using custom shaders.
- **Terrain-RGB Decoding**: Decodes elevation tiles directly on GPU for performance.
- **Interactive Placement**: Click to place observer and instantly see viewshed calculation.
- **Visual Feedback**: Red/green overlay indicates obstructed vs. visible terrain areas.
- **Seamless Integration**: Fetches elevation tiles from the same OpenTopoData backend.

_Note: This feature is in active development. Advanced features like Fresnel zone analysis are planned for future releases._

### 📡 Link Analysis Optimizations

- **Smarter API Updates**: Link analysis now only triggers when both TX and RX points are placed, preventing unnecessary API calls.
- **Improved UX**: Moving a single marker no longer clears the previous analysis result until the second point is placed.
- **Reduced Backend Load**: Eliminated redundant API requests during marker placement workflow.
- **Cleaner State Management**: Better handling of partial link configurations.

### 🧹 Code Quality & Security

- **Code Cleanup**: Removed 80+ lines of unnecessary comments and verbose documentation.

  - Cleaned up `tile_manager.py` (meshgrid interpolation comments)
  - Updated all Mapbox-specific references to generic "Terrain-RGB" terminology
  - Removed redundant comments in `server.py` and `ViewshedLayer.js`

- **Security Audit**: Comprehensive security scan with zero critical findings.
  - ✅ No exposed API keys or credentials
  - ✅ Proper environment variable usage throughout codebase
  - ✅ `.gitignore` correctly prevents sensitive file commits
  - ⚠️ Identified CORS and Redis auth as production hardening items

### 📋 Feature Status Clarification

Features marked as **"In Development"** in documentation and UI:

- **Find Ideal Spot** - Optimal node placement search
- **Heatmap** - Coverage analysis visualization
- **ViewShed** - Terrain visibility analysis (Beta)

These features are functional but may have incomplete behavior or missing advanced features.

### 🔧 Breaking Changes

- **Removed**: Mapbox API dependency and `MAPBOX_TOKEN` environment variable
- **Migration**: Users upgrading should remove `MAPBOX_TOKEN` from their `.env` files

### 📚 Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with OpenTopoData configuration guide
- Added ViewShed section to feature list
- Marked in-development features with warning indicators
- Removed duplicate docker-compose configuration sections

## v1.1 - UI Polish & Local Data

This release focuses on usability improvements and a transition to a more robust, local-first data model.

### 📍 Usability Experience (UX)

- **Optimization Tool Refinement**:

  - **Glassmorphism Overlays**: New success/failure notifications with modern styling.
  - **Persistent State**: Clearing optimization results now keeps the tool active for rapid re-testing.
  - **Visual Feedback**: Added loading spinners during terrain scans.

- **Link Analysis (LOS) Workflow**:
  - **Smart Toggles**: Disabling the Link Analysis tool now automatically clears the map to ensure a clean workspace.
  - **New "Clear Link" Button**: Added a dedicated floating action button to reset the current analysis without exiting the tool.

### 🛠️ Backend & Data

- **Local SRTM Migration**:

  - Removed dependency on external Elevation APIs (OpenTopography).
  - **Offline Capable**: The `rf-engine` now requires local `.hgt` (SRTM) files in the `./cache` directory.
  - **Efficiency**: Removed `requests` library dependency for a lighter container footprint.

- **Dev Experience**:
  - Updated `docker-compose` to support local container builds for the web app, mirroring the backend workflow.

## v1.0 - Professional Edition

This major release transforms **meshRF** into a professional-grade RF planning tool, introducing geodetic physics, batch processing, and a completely modernized UI.

### 🌐 Physics Engine Upgrade

- **Geodetic Earth Model**: Implemented curved-earth calculations with configurable **K-Factor**.
- **Accurate Fresnel Analysis**: Now strictly enforces the **60% Clearance Rule** (WISP Standard) for link quality ratings (Excellent/Good/Marginal/Obstructed).
- **Clutter Awareness**: Added support for **Clutter Height** (trees/urban) in obstruction analysis.

### ⚡ Batch Processing

- **CSV Import**: Analyze hundreds of nodes at once by importing a simple CSV (`Name, Lat, Lon`).
- **Matrix Analysis**: Automatically computes link feasibility for every pair of nodes (N\*(N-1)/2 links).
- **Bulk Export**: Download detailed link budget reports (RSSI, Margin, Clearance) as CSV.

### 🎨 UI Modernization

- **Responsive Sidebar**: Collapsible, glassmorphism sidebar that works perfectly on mobile devices.
- **Floating Controls**: Smart "Tab" toggle that floats independently of the sidebar.
- **Visual Polish**: Custom dark-mode scrollbars, refined typography, and new "meshRF" branding with custom iconography.
- **Link Analysis Panel**: Now fully resizable with a draggable handle for better chart visibility.

### 🛠️ Configuration & Deployment

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `VITE_ELEVATION_API_URL`: Configure your own elevation provider (e.g., self-hosted Open-Meteo).
  - `VITE_MAP_LAT` / `VITE_MAP_LNG`: Set custom default starting coordinates.
- **Refined Docker**: Optimized Docker Compose setup for easy deployment.
